You can also do a search by doing Ctrl + F on Windows and Linux or Cmd + F on Mac. General \u00b6 How do I get started? \u00b6 First you will need to get a phone. As long as your phone will allow or handle SIP, you are good to go. Then check out our Getting Started Guide to start the process. You can also look through the rest of the Wiki to get an idea on how to get started. Where can I go for more help? \u00b6 You are already in the best place for getting more help! This Wiki. This is where alot of guides and information can be found about the service and things are added all the time. Next place you can go is one of our Chat Services . Our main form of communication is Discord, but some other chat services are bridged into it. Can I contribute to the Wiki? \u00b6 Absolutely! We encourage our user community to contribute to the Wiki to help expand the knowledge here. To see how, check out our Getting Started Guide What Feature Codes can I use on the system? \u00b6 All Feature Codes can be found in the Feature Codes Guide Troubleshooting \u00b6 The light for my HOIP extension is not green (its orange, amber, yellow) and I have not changed anything on my end. What has happened or what do I do? \u00b6 This is becoming a common issue on the service we are finding. This could be a Carrier Grade NAT situation. We might have to make some adjustments on the peer for your extension. Some steps to take first (in order): Reboot your modem Reboot your router Reboot your phone Double check to make sure none of your configuration has changed (password, domain, etc.) If you are using Hamshack Hotline, please check here to make sure the settings are correct. If these do not fix the issue, you will need to open a ticket to the helpdesk. We will need to make some adjustments. In the ticket, please include the following information: Your name, callsign Your extension Mention the fact that your light is orange Include your IP Address One thing to note here, if you have a Dyanmic DNS Service like DuckDNS or No-IP or similiar, this can be used as well, and is actually prefered. That way we don;t have to keep updating your IP address. Do a search for Dynamic DNS Services online. To get your IP address, please go to https://pb.hamsoverip.com/diy and copy and paste the IP address that is shown there into the ticket. This will allow the admins to make the adjustments needed and then they will get back to you about the fix being implemented. I had to reprovision my phone (with HH) and now HOIP will not work. How do I fix this? \u00b6 Hamshack Hotline provisions certain phones from their servers and take over line 1 of the phone. When a user needs to reprovision since HH does not care if other services could be running on the phone, there are alot of settings problems that are induced to the phone by them, which causes problems for end users. For those of you that have reprovisioned your phone due to Hamshack Hotline or a factory reset and then reprovisioning Hamshack Hotline to fix these issues and be able to use other services: Goto your HOIP extension tab and change TCP to UDP. In the SYSTEM tab, please fill in PRIMARY DNS with 8.8.8.8 SECONDARY DNS to 8.8.4.4 or you can use DNS servers of your choice (for example if you run a DNS source on your home network like Pi-Hole or if you don't want to use the Google servers above). Make sure you have your HOIP extension configured with the proper credentials. Submit changes and reboot. Phones \u00b6 What phones work with HOIP? \u00b6 The nice thing about the Hams Over IP service is we are a BOYD (Bring Your Own Device) service. So any phone that you can configure for SIP connections can be used on the service, on any peer. We have people that use Cisco, Grandstream, Polycomm, Yealink, Fanvil, Softphones and many other types of phones. As long as you can configure the phone to use SIP, you are good to go. How do I configure X phone to work with HOIP? \u00b6 Take a look through the Configuration Guides in the Wiki and see if your phone has a configuration guide. If not, you can ask on any of our chat services to see if someone has configured it. If there is not a configuration guide, you are also welcome to contribute to the Wiki and add a guide for your phone. That would help out others. To see how to contribute, look at the Contributing Guide . I had to reprovision my phone or factory reset my phone and I cannot find/lost my credientals. What do I do? \u00b6 If you can't find your credentials, you can put a ticket into the Helpdesk Ticketing system and request your credentials be resent to you. How do I access my Voicemail? \u00b6 Dial *97 from your phone or hit the voicemail button. This will drop you into your mailbox. If this is the first time accessing your mailbox, the system will walk you through setting up your outgoing voicemail messages and make you change your pin. Once you have all this setup, all you need to do is dial *97 from your phone, or hit the voicemail button and it will just drop you into your box to let you retreive messages. PBXs \u00b6 What PBXs work with HOIP? \u00b6 Good Question. As of right now, we know that FreePBX and 3CX both work with the service. Both can connect via SIP Trunks and FreePBX is able to use IAX. But otherwise, we don't really know of more. If you know of others that use SIP Trunks and can configure them, we would like to know more about it. In fact, if you can create a configuration guide, please submit it. If you want to use FreePBX or 3CX, please check out the configuration guides for each here in the Wiki. How do I configure my PBX to work with HOIP? \u00b6 Good question! If it's one we have a guide for, check out the configuration guides for the PBXs. If it's one that we don't have a guide for, please write one up and submit it. Website/Ticket System \u00b6 I am a new user and just created an account in OS Ticket, but I am not able to log in. \u00b6 Chances are pretty good the verification email from the system was sent to your spam folder. There are some email providers that either block or mark the emails as spam. Check your spam folder. If it's not there, it might have been blocked. Reach out to an admin on Discord and see if they can activate your account. Once that is done, you should be able to log in and see your tickets. I put a ticket in to get a new extension, but I have not gotten my credentials email? \u00b6 This could be a couple of things: Remember we are all volunteers. We try to get to tickets as quick as we can, but we also have lives outside of this project. So it could take a day or two before we can get to the ticket Possibly the same reason as above. Your email provider spam foldered it or blocked it.

This allows you to use any number of phones on your extension, control your own voicemail and many other things. In many ways, it's easier to run your own PBX then it is to try to connect multiple phones to our system. The more people who can use a their own PBX is the less number of phones trying to register to our network and helps keep resources free. 3CX is only a SIP based PBX. Therefore, when requesting a new line for use with 3CX, you will just need to request a new extension. DO NOT REQUEST A TRUNK. If you request a trunk, it will be configured for an IAX connection for Asterisk/FreePBX. We do not want that. Also, if you already have an extension on the HOIP Network, you do not need to have it converted or anything. All you would be doing is replacing your existing endpoint with 3CX and then connecting to that your existing endpoint to your new PBX. You don't have to configure Voicemail on 3CX if you do not want to and continue to use your existing voicemail box provided on the HOIP Network. If you want to use voicemail on the 3CX PBX, see the note at the end of this document on steps to take. It does take a bit of work to get your own PBX configured and setup, but it in the end, the rewards are nice. This guide assumes that you already have a 3CX PBX setup and ready and have also setup user extensions and voicemail boxes. There are many other guides on the Internet explaining how to do this, so that is outside the scope of this document. Configuring the Trunk \u00b6 Create the Trunk \u00b6 Log into your 3CX PBX Management Console. Click on SIP Trunks in the left hand column. Click Add SIP Trunk . Select Generic in the Select Country dropdown. Then select Asterisk in the Select Provider in your Country dropdown. Enter the extension number/Username that you received in the email from the HOIP System in the Main Trunk No field. Click Ok . This should drop you into the edit screen for the trunk. Now give it a name in the Enter name for Trunk field (Suggested \"HOIP\") In the Registrar/Server/Gateway Hostname or IP field, enter the FQDN of of the PBX Server your extension is on. This will be in the email from the HOIP system. You will only need to put the FQDN in the first box. In the box at the end of that line, you will need to put the port in (5160). Example FQDN: pbx-us1.hamsoverip.com Scroll down to the Authentication section In the Type of Authentication drop down select Register/Account based Put the extension (username) in the Authentication ID (aka SIP User ID) field. Again, this is from the email that you received from the HOIP System. Put the password from the email in the Authentication Password field. Leave the rest as default. Click OK at the top to save the settings. Wait a minute or two for the trunk to register. It should register, unless you entered something wrong. If it does not register, go back and check all your settings. Configure 3CX Outbound Rule \u00b6 Once we have the Trunk setup and registered correctly, now we need an outbound route. This is so you can make calls out of your PBX. Click on Outbound Rules on the left hand menu. Click Add . Give it a name in Rule Name (Suggested: \"HOIP Outbound\") In the Calls to numbers starting with prefix give it a prefix for dialing. This would be a number that the PBX would see at the beginning of the dialed number that it would know to use this new route. I used 8 for mine. If you know of or remember the old \"Dial 9 for an outside line\" thing in offices, this is the same thing. This way you don't accidently dial out of your HOIP trunk if you are trying to make a different call. Scroll Down to the Make outbound calls on Section. For Route 1 select the HOIP Trunk we configured above. In the Strip Digits dropdown, choose the number 1. This will strip off the prefix we defined above and then send the rest of the number dialed down the \"trunk\". Click OK at the top to save your settings. Now whenever you want to dial someone on HOIP, you will dial 8+<The Extension> (example: 8100070 for N8ACL). Any other house type calls will not go out this trunk. If you use this for a home PBX, you will need to make sure to dial 1-800 or 1-855 to make toll free calls on your home number, depending on the number you use for the prefix. Configure 3CX Inbound Rule \u00b6 Once we have the Trunk setup and registered correctly, now we need an outbound route. Click on Inbound Rules on the left hand menu. Click Add DID Rule . Give it a name in Name (Suggested: \"HOIP Inbound\") In the DID/DDI give it your extension number on HOIP. In the Route calls to Section, this is where you set the routing for the incoming calls for HOIP. You can route both (internal and external) to a specific extension or to a ring group if you have one setup. You could also route the calls to a voicemail box directly if you wanted to. Click OK at the top to save your settings. Now Test \u00b6 Now pickup a phone and call an extension on HOIP to test it and also see if you can have someone call you. Everything should flow correctly. Voicemail Options \u00b6 The nice thing about 3CX is you can have the PBX handle your voicemail, or you can have HOIP handle the voicemail. If you want HOIP to handle voicemail, just disable the voicemail options for the extension that incoming HOIP calls are being routed to on 3CX. If you want to handle voicemail your self, you have two additional options for this: You can have your HOIP Voicemail box disabled and have everything roll to your PBX You can set your pickup time on voicemail to 10 seconds on your 3CX PBX voicemail. This will pickup your call and send it to voicemail before HOIP. This option allows you to keep your HOIP Voicemail Box as a backup in case your PBX goes off line for some reason, allowing you to continue to get voicemails to your extension.

DO NOT request a trunk. This will get you setup an IAX Trunk and that will not work with this method. The Ham's Over IP service offers the ability to connect your home FreePBX PBX System to our system. This allows you to use any number of phones on your extension, control your own voicemail and many other things. In many ways, it's easier to run your own PBX then it is to try to connect multiple phones to our system.

There are many other guides on the Internet explaining how to do this, so that is outside the scope of this document. If you already have an extension on the HOIP Network, you do not need to have it converted or anything. All you would be doing is replacing your existing endpoint with FreePBX and then connecting to that your existing endpoint to your new PBX. You don't have to configure Voicemail on FreePBX if you do not want to and continue to use your existing voicemail box provided on the HOIP Network. If you want to use voicemail on your FreePBX, see the note at the end of this document on steps to take. Why would you want to configure a SIP trunk over an IAX trunk? Let's take a look at a couple scenarios: You started out as just a phone and had it connected to HOIP via SIP, but decided you wanted a little more freedom by running your own PBX. You want to offer some audio services or other services on the same extension as your regular phone. You find out how much cooler it is to run a SIP trunk vs an IAX Trunk. There are some additonal steps to setting up a SIP trunk, but in many ways it is still easier to set up a SIP trunk versus an IAX Trunk. Configuring the Trunk \u00b6 Create the Trunk \u00b6 Log into your PBX admin screen Click Conectivity and then Trunks Click Add Trunk on the next screen and then select Add SIP (chan_pjsip) Trunk in the drop down. You should now be in the Add Trunk screen. Fill in the fields as such: Trunk Name - Name of the Trunk. Suggested: HOIP Hide CallerID - Make sure this is set to No . Outbound CallerID - Your actual extension. This would be the extension for the Trunk that was sent to you in the email. CID Options - Make sure this is set for Allow Any CID . Disable Trunk - Make sure this is set for No . Leave the Defaults for everything else. Next Click the pjsip Settings tab. On that screen edit the following: On the General Tab: Username - This is your extension number from the email. Auth username - This is your extension number from the email. secret - This is the password of your extension from the email. SIP Server - this is the domain of the PBX server from your email. ex. pbx-us1.hamsoverip.com SIP Server Port - This is the port of the PBX server from your email. Typically this will always be 5160 . Leave all other defaults Once that is filled out go to the Advanced tab and find the following fields: Contact User - This will be your extension from the email. From User - This will also be your extension from the email. Click Submit and then Apply Changes at the top right. Create Outbound Route \u00b6 Once you have the trunk created, you will need to configure an Outgoing Route in order to make outgoing calls on your trunk. Click Conectivity and then Outbound Routes Click Add Route . You should now be in the Edit Route Screen. You will need to fill in the fields as follows: Route Name - This is the name you want to call your outgoing route. Suggested: HOIP Skip down to Trunk Sequence for Matched Routes and select the HOIP Trunk you created earlier.

Click Submit and then Click the red Apply Changes in the upper right corner of the screen. You should now be able to make and receive calls across your HOIP Trunk. Voicemail Options \u00b6 The nice thing about FreePBX is you can have the PBX handle your voicemail, or you can have HOIP handle the voicemail. If you want HOIP to handle voicemail, just disable the voicemail options for the extension that incoming HOIP calls are being routed to on your FreePBX. If you want to handle voicemail your self, you have two additional options for this: You can have your HOIP Voicemail box disabled and have everything roll to your PBX You can set your pickup time on voicemail to 10 seconds on your FreePBX voicemail. This will pickup your call and send it to voicemail before HOIP. This option allows you to keep your HOIP Voicemail Box as a backup in case your PBX goes off line for some reason, allowing you to continue to get voicemails to your extension. To do this in FreePBX: Click on Settings at the top of the screen. This should put you into the FreePBX Advanced Settings screen. Scroll down and find the Ringtime Default . The default setting is 15 seconds. Set this to 10. This will allow your extension to ring for 10 seconds and then your voicemail will pick up before the HOIP one does. If your PBX goes offline, the call will roll over to the HOIP voicemail system instead. Then Submit and Apply Changes .

If the line is busy, in other words, someone is using the line, it will glow red, otherwise it will glow green. This works for normal extensions and conference bridges as well as the RF-Links Extensions. If someone is dialed into a conference, the light will be red, indicating someone is in the conference, otherwise it will glow green. This Guide describes how to configure the feature on Cisco Phones and Cisco Sidecars. Other phones will probably have a different function string to make this work. In order to do this, you will need to access the Web Configuration of the phone. How this is done varies from phone model to phone model, but for most, if you open a web browser and go to the IP address of the phone, you should be able to access the Web Configuration Interface. From there, you will need to navigate to the extension you want to edit, be it a button on the phone or on the sidecar. When you are at the extension you want to edit, you will need to look for the Extended Function Field for that line and in that you will place something similiar to the following: fnc = sd+blf ; ext = <extension to Monitor>@ $PROXY ; nme = <Friendly Name> ; Where: fnc=sd+blf; - This sets the function of the button for both a speedial and BLF for that button ext=<extension to monitor>@$PROXY; - This is the extension you want to Speedial/monitor. $PROXY is a variable that is taken from another part of the phone configuration. Leave that alone. That just basically sets the server. name=<Friendly Name>; This sets the name of the button that is displayed on the phone screen or the sidecar screen (if it has one). If you are using a sidecar without a screen, this can be omitted for that. OPTIONAL: if you are using a sidecar, you can add vid=N where N is the number of the line you want to send the call out. In other words, let's say you have a Home VOIP number on line 1 and HOIP on line 2 and you want this button to speedial an extension on HOIP, you would set it to look like vid=2 .

Note that this does not enable Autopatch from the RF connection. This is a one way connection from HOIP to your RF system, basically a reverse autopatch if you will. All RF-Link Extensions will be in the format of 15XXX , 25XXX or 35000 . Creating an RF Connection \u00b6 To create a connection , you first need to have a properly configured AllStar Node. Asterisk is needed to connect to the HOIP system as the HOIP system is based on Asterisk (FreePBX is the GUI front End to Asterisk) as well. There is plenty of documentation online on configuring an Allstar Node, so that is outside the scope of this document. It is recommended, but not required, that you configure a private node on your AllStar Node when configuring the node to have the phone connection tie to. This will allow you to disconnect the phone connection from your AllStar node in case there is a problem. Also, we ask that you check to make sure your PTT command is setup to be *99 and release to be # in your rpt.conf file if you do not already have this setup. This will make sure that once someone dials in that they do not cause interference or problems on accident. This will also make all PTT commands uniform for the system. This should be already set by default, but if you made changes at some point, this may have been changed. On your Allstar Node \u00b6 You will need to edit the IAX.conf and extensions.conf files. In your iax.conf you will need to configure a stanza similar to this: [stanza-must-match-username] username=<username-must-match-stanza> type=user context=hoipphone host=dynamic auth=md5 secret=<choose a password> disallow=all allow=ulaw allow=g726aal2 allow=gsm codecpriority=host transfer=no In your extensions.conf you need to configure a stanza similar to below. * Note : you need to change the node numbers shown below to the node that you are having the connection dial into. So, if you configured a private node and if, for example, that node number is 1999, then you would use 1999 in place of 47374 below: [hoipphone] exten => 47374,1,answer() exten => 47374,n,Playback(rpt/node) exten => 47374,n,Playback(digits/4) exten => 47374,n,Playback(digits/7) exten => 47374,n,Playback(digits/3) exten => 47374,n,Playback(digits/7) exten => 47374,n,Playback(digits/4) exten => 47374,n,Playback(rpt/connected) exten => 47374,n,Set(CALLSIGN=HOIP-${CALLERID(name)}) exten => 47374,n,rpt(47374|P|${CALLSIGN}) exten => 47374,n,rpt,47374|P Please be sure you have an FQDN for your network.

Please use an IAX client and test your credentials that you used for HOIP from outside of your network to ensure connectivity. Connecting to Ham's Over IP \u00b6 Once you have your node configured, you will need to request an RF-Link Extension on the HOIP system through the HOIP ticketing system.

Make sure to modify this example IAX Dial String to match your system correctly. The IAX2 Dial String is formatted like this: IAX2/username:password@fqdn:port/node-number So for an example: IAX2/username:password@fqdn:4569/1999 This is the most important part.

Sometimes it takes a village to share the wealth of knowledge out there. This guide will provide methods to make submissions to the wiki as well as the process to expect when a submission is made. Goals \u00b6 Remember, there are some things that you need to keep in mind when submitting new things or changes to the wiki: The directions must be clear and concise. It must be able to be replicated by someone else. Someone should be able to take your document and starting at the top, they should be able to move step by step through it and at the end have the same thing setup as you have. Don't be discouraged if your changes or new item is rejected. It just didn't fit what we needed at the time. If it was rejected, you will be told why and what needs to be done to fix it for it to be included. Methods to Contribute \u00b6 GitHub Pull Request \u00b6 If you are familiar with how Git and Github works, or you have used Github before, you can fork and clone the wiki repo https://github.com/hamsoverip/wiki , make a change and do a pull request to submit it back. Once the PR has been reviewed and merged, the change will be deployed to the wiki site automatically. That is all you need to do if you are submitting that way. This is good for both new items and change requests. If you have forked and cloned a previous version of the repo, PLEASE make sure that you merge any outstanding commits from the main repo to your fork and then do a git pull prior to doing any local editing. This wiki is always in flux and if you do not merge those commits and then do a pull prior to starting editing, you will either miss updates or overwrite things on the repo. It is always good practice to do a merge and a pull prior to starting work on a forked repo anyway. This makes sure you are on the most current main branch edits. Non-Github related way \u00b6 If you are not familiar with Github, or do not have an account, that is ok. You can still contribute. If this is just a change request (in other words something needs to be changed or updated on the wiki), please submit it in the Wiki Chat channel on Discord. No need to format it or anything. This would be things like \"This word is mis-spelled\" or \"can you add this?\" if it is longer, like a rework of an existing document, then please put it into a Markdown Document to make updating easier. If this is a whole new item, it is asked that you make the submission using a Markdown Document. If you are not familiar with Markdown, it is a very simple way to format text files. In fact, this wiki is actually done in Markdown. Markdown makes documentation much easier as it is easier to format commands and such in a way that is familiar. A Markdown Primer can be found here . Submission \u00b6 If you are not using Github to do a pull request, to submit the file, please upload the file to the Wiki Chat channel on Discord. The person in charge of the Wiki will take it and review it. Approval Process \u00b6 Once the change has been submitted, the document will be reviewed. If more clarification is needed, changes will be asked for and the updated file resubmitted. Once everything is in order, the change will be approved and the submission included in the wiki. This process is in place to make sure we have very good and complete documentation on things. It does no good to have a wiki and have things that do not work. But at the same time, if you want to make a submission, be thorough. Go through the process of creating the documentation. Tips for Submission \u00b6 Look though the Markdown Primer linked above. Look at the Github repo (it's a public repo) for the HOIP Wiki to use documents as examples of how to proceed and how to structure your document https://github.com/hamsoverip/wiki . If you have questions, ask. That is what the Wiki Chat is for in Discord. Or reach out to Jeff, N8ACL on Discord directly (@Ravendos#7364). Please do not submit anything other then a Markdown Document. This will get your submission rejected right off the bat till it is in the correct format. Tips and Tricks Learned about MKDocs \u00b6 Typically in Markdown, you only need to indent 2 spaces for nested lists. Apparently in MKDocs, you need to indent 4 Spaces. The upstream provider for the Markdown Plugin for MKDocs has decided to die on a hill and say this is not a bug, which sadly it is. So when doing nested lists (sub points in a list) make sure to indent them 4 spaces.
